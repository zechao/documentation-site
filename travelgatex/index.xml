      <description>This page provides an overview of the TravelgateX platform.
GraphQL Gateway TravelgateX is the travel API completely based in GraphQL. Unlike many legacy XML Soap APIs, GraphQL enables each client to ask for and receive exactly the data that is needed. Learn more by reading our Learning GraphQL guides.
Our Gateway is the only endpoint to access all of our APIs. It is written in NodeJS. This makes it fast, stable, secure, fault tolerant and load balanced between many datacenters from four different cloud providers: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Hetzner and TotalUptime.</description>
